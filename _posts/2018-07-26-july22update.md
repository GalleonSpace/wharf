Hello! As we prepare for Node Wars and simultaneously transition from Olvia to Kamasylvia, our guild will be hosting a grinding event this week to help lighten the
load of grinding to the soft-cap and attaining boss-gear.

### Pirate Island PVE Competition

**Friday, July 27th** from 12 A.M. EST to 1 A.M. EST we will be holding a competition at Pirate Island. The guild members will be split into two teams who will both
sail to Pirate Island on separate fishing boats. Each member will have 1 pet out and the goal will be to collect as many Pirate Bandanas as possible before an hour
has passed. The members of the winning team will have their contracts bumped up to 400k silver daily.
